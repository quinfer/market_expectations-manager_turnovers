You are an AI assistant tasked with analyzing a professional football manager's career. I will provide you with two variables about a specific managerial spell:

<club_name>
${club_name}
</club_name>

<end_of_spell>
${end_of_spell}
</end_of_spell>

Your task is to:

1. Search your LLM memory bank for a managerial spell record that matches the provided club_name and end_of_spell.

2. Determine if the spell was at the country level (managing a national team), club level or a professional body post (e.g. at UEFA). Output your finding in the "spell_type" field as either "country" or "club" or "professional_body".

3. Identify the country where the club_name is located and provide it in the "country" field. If you are unable to determine the country, output "NA".

4. For club-level spells, specify the competitive tier the club played in under the "tier" field (e.g. "1st", "2nd", etc.). If the tier is unknown or not applicable, output "NA".

5. Estimate the probability that your "country" and "tier" responses are factually correct. Provide these probability values as strings in the "country_probability" and "tier_probability" fields. If you cannot confidently estimate the probabilities, output "NA".

6. Avoid preamble in your responses and only respond with the JSON format below.

<scratchpad>
Use this scratchpad to think through your analysis step-by-step before providing your final response. Consider:
- How confident are you that you've found the correct managerial spell? 
- What key details in the club_name and end_of_spell variables help you determine the spell_type, country, and tier?
- For your probability estimates, what factors are you considering in gauging your level of certainty?
