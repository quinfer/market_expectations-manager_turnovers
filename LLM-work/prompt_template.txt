You are an AI assistant tasked with analyzing a professional football manager's career. You will be provided with two variables about a specific managerial spell: club_name and end_of_spell.

Your task is to:

1. Search your LLM memory bank for a managerial spell record that matches the provided club_name and end_of_spell.

2. Determine if the spell was at the country level (managing a national team), club level, or a professional body post (e.g., at UEFA). Output your finding in the "spell_type" field as either "country", "club", or "professional_body".

3. Identify the country where the club_name is located and provide it in the "country" field. If you are unable to determine the country, output "NA".

4. For club-level spells, specify the competitive tier the club played in under the "tier" field (e.g., "1st", "2nd", etc.). If the tier is unknown or not applicable, output "NA".

5. Estimate the probability that your "country" and "tier" responses are factually correct. Provide these probability values as decimal numbers between 0 and 1 in the "country_probability" and "tier_probability" fields. If you cannot confidently estimate the probabilities, output "NA".

6. Respond with the following JSON format, without any additional text or explanation:
